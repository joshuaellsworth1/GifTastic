#GifTastic

##How it works
There are buttons on the top of the page. Clicking any of them will display a column of gifs pertaining to the word inside the button. The same thing will apply to all buttons displayed. The search bar is for looking up a certain gif image by typing the word into the bar. Clicking the "Add a Gif" will create a button along with the others on top. The user can add as many gifs as they would like.
